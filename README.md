#PROJECT OVERVIEW:

This Penetration Testing Toolkit is a modular cybersecurity tool designed to help security professionals and ethical hackers test the security of web applications and networks. The toolkit is built using Python (Flask) for the backend and provides multiple functionalities, such as Port Scanning and Brute-Force Attacks. The modular structure allows for easy expansion by adding more security testing features in the future. The project is structured with separate Python scripts for each module inside a modules/ folder, making the codebase clean and maintainable. The backend serves as the core engine that processes user input, performs security tests, and returns results. The toolkit runs on a command-line interface (CLI) but can be extended with a web-based frontend using Flask and JavaScript to provide a more user-friendly experience.

The Port Scanner module helps identify open ports on a target machine by scanning user-specified IP addresses and ports, allowing users to check for vulnerabilities in network security. The Brute-Force Attack module attempts to crack login credentials by testing multiple passwords from a list against a given target website. Users can specify a login URL, username, and a password list file, and the system will systematically test each password to check for weak authentication mechanisms. The backend ensures proper error handling, preventing crashes due to missing files or incorrect input formats. This project is useful for cybersecurity learners, penetration testers, and developers who want to enhance their understanding of security vulnerabilities in web applications and networks. By integrating Flask, users can later add a web interface, making the toolkit easier to use. Future improvements may include features like SQL Injection detection, XSS testing, and automated vulnerability scanning, making it a comprehensive security testing tool.
